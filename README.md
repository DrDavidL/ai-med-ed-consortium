# AI in Medical Education Consortium

A multi-institutional collaborative advancing the thoughtful integration of artificial intelligence into medical education.

---

## The Challenge

AI is transforming healthcare at a pace that mandates preparation of the next generation of physicians. However, medical educators face significant hurdles: governance frameworks that don't yet exist, faculty development that can't keep up, and the very real risk of "deskilling" or "never-skilling" our trainees. Meanwhile, every institution is writing the same policies from scratch, building the same curricula in parallel, and solving the same problems in isolation.

Together, we can do better.

## What We're Building

This consortium brings together medical education leaders from major academic health systems to:

**Share, don't duplicate.** Policies, curricula, assessment tools, and faculty development resources — built once, adapted everywhere.

**Move fast, stay grounded.** Working groups focused on tangible outputs, not endless task forces.

**Bridge education and operations.** AI in the classroom must connect to AI in the clinic. We're building those bridges.

**Partner with industry.** Co-developing tools with the companies building them, not reacting after the fact.

## Thematic Groups

| Group | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Curriculum** | Foundational and advanced AI education for learners at every stage |
| **Faculty Development** | Baseline to advanced AI knowledge and teaching skills for educators |
| **Policy & Governance** | Shared frameworks, infrastructure guidance, institutional adoption |
| **Assessment** | AI-powered evaluation, smarter feedback, freeing faculty for human interaction |
| **Ethics & Equity** | Responsible use, disclosure requirements, verification practices, professionalism |
| **Research & Scholarship** | Collaborative studies, validity evidence, dissemination |

## Why This Matters

Medical students are already using AI. Residents are dictating notes with ambient scribes. Attendings are getting diagnostic predictions they didn't ask for. The question isn't whether AI will transform medical education — it already is.

The question is whether we'll prepare our learners to use these tools wisely, critically, and ethically. Whether we'll develop faculty who can teach what they themselves are still learning. Whether we'll create policies that protect patients while enabling innovation.

This consortium exists because none of us can answer these questions alone.

## Get Involved

We're actively recruiting faculty and trainees with expertise or interest in:
- Curriculum design and educational technology
- Clinical informatics and AI implementation
- Medical education research and assessment
- Health equity and AI ethics
- Faculty development and change management
